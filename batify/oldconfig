FUTURE Implements:

[
- 1: yes
- 0: no

	battery-care : 1
	ext-power-consume-soft : 1
	hibernate-on-low : 1 (This is actual battery percentage value, or 0: no)
	daily-report : 0 (creates a report file at specified time)
	daily-report-time: 1800 (use 24-hours format)			
]

NOTE: Do not leave equal-to sign without a variable and its assigned [numerical] value
---

---
This config will only consider a variable and its value to be acceptable
if it contains a space before and after an equal-to sign. 
anything else will be scrapped.

check-interval: scans for changes over [X]seconds
battery-warning: at what percentage to warn
batter-charged-warning: when to unplug the charger. [Helpful]
